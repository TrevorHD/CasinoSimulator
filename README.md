# CasinoSimulator

A set of text-based casino games, built in Python, that are designed to run on the command line or Python interpreter. Blackjack and roulette are currently available, and a slots game has been planned for the near future.

## Scripts

**Blackjack** *(.py)* - Script for running the blackjack game; no dependencies.

**Roulette** *(.py)* - Script for running the roulette game; has dependencies for *numpy* and *pandas*, so these must be present in your environment to run properly.

**Slots** *(.py)* - Script for running the blackjack game; no dependencies. ***Coming soon!***
